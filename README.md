Tripify – Tourism & Travel Exploration Website

Tripify is an interactive tourism and travel exploration website designed to help users discover popular tourist destinations and plan their trips effectively. The project provides an engaging visual experience where users can explore famous places, view detailed information, and navigate smoothly between different sections of the website.

The application features a welcoming home page followed by a Favourite Places section that highlights iconic Indian tourist destinations such as Taj Mahal, Golden Temple, Mysore Palace, and Varanasi Temple. Each destination includes a dedicated detailed view with image carousels and descriptive content, allowing users to learn more about the history, culture, and significance of each place.

Tripify is developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, focusing on responsive design, smooth navigation, and interactive UI components like sliders and buttons. The project demonstrates how tourism platforms present destinations in a visually appealing and structured way, making it easier for users to explore and plan travel ideas.
